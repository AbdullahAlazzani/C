//This program started in Chapter 3 and was modified in Chapter 4. Starting with the version
described in Chapter 4, modify the program again so that it displays a menu allowing the user
to select an addition, subtraction, or multiplication problem. The final selection on the menu
should let the user quit the program. After the user has finished the math problem, the program
should display the menu again. This process must repeat until the user chooses to quit the program.
If the user selects an item not on the menu, the program should print an error message and then
display the menu again.
