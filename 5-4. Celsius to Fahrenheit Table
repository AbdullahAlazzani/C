// In one of the Chapte r 3 Programming Challenges you were asked to write a program that converts
a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit. Modify that program so it uses a loop to display a table of the
Celsius temperatures from O to 30 and their Fahrenheit equivalents. 
F = 9!5C + 32 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
double const conversion = 1.8;
cout << "Celsius              Fahrenheit "<< endl;
cout<<"-----------------------"<<endl;
for (int i = 0; i<=30; ++i)
{
  cout<< " "<< i<< "           "<< (conversion * i) + 32<< endl;
}
}
