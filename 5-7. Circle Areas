//The formula to compute the area of a circle is area = PI * radius^2 
so if a circle's radius doubles (i.e., is multiplied by 2), the circle's area 
will be four times as large as before. Write a program that creates a table
showing the radius and area for a circle whose radius begins with
1 and continues doubling until it is 8. Use 3.14 for Pl.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
double const pi = 3.14;
cout<<"\nRaduys         Area"<<endl;
cout<<"--------------------"<<endl;
for (int i = 1; i <= 8; i*=2)
{
  cout<<" "<<i<<"             "<< pi * (i*i)<<endl;
}
}
