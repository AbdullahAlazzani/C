//There are three seating categories at a stadium.
For a softball game, Class A seats cost $15,
Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9.
Write a program that asks how many tickets for each
class of seats were sold, then displays the amount
of income generated from ticket sales. Format your
dollar amount in a fixed-point notation with two decimal
points and make sure the decimal point is always displayed.
