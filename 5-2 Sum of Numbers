//Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value and that uses a loop to
validate the input. The program should then use a second loop to compute the sum of
all the integers from 1 up to the number entered . For example, if the user enters 50, the
loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 50. 

{
	int value, sum=0;

	cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
	cin >> value;

	while (value <= 0)
	{
		cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
		cin >> value;
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= value; ++i)
	{
		sum += i;
	}
	cout << "The sum of numbers 1 through " << value << " is: " << sum << endl;
}
