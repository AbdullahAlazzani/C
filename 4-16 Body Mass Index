//Write a program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index (BMI). The BMI
is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or
underweight for his or her height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:
BMI = weight x 703/height2
where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. 

#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

int main(void){
  
  double weight, height, BMI;
  cout << "Enter your weight in pounds?"<< endl;
  cin >> weight;
  cout <<  "Enter your height in inches?";
  cin >> height;
  BMI = weight * (703/ pow(height, 2));
  
   if (BMI < 18.5)
  {
    cout << "A body mass index of " << BMI << " is classified as underweight." << endl;
  }
  else if (BMI > 25)
  {
    cout << "A body mass index of " << BMI << " is classified as overweight." << endl;
  }
  else
    cout << "A body mass index of " << BMI << " is classified as optimal." << endl;
}
