//The date June 10, 1960, is special because when we write it in the following format,
the month times the day equals the year.
6/10/60
Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a
two-digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day is
equa l to the year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise,
it should display a message saying the date is not magic.
Input Validation: Think about what legal values the program should accept for
month and day. 

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int month, day, year;
    cout << "Enter the number of the month?"<<endl;
    cin >> month;
    if (month < 1 || month > 12)
    {
        cout<< "Please run the program again and enter a valid number.";
        return 0;
    }
    cout <<"Enter the number of the day?"<< endl;
    cin >>day;
    if (day < 1 || day > 31)
    {
        cout<< "Please run the program again and enter a valid number.";
        return 0;
    }
    cout << "Enter the last two numbers of the year? (EX: 2019, enter 19)"<<endl;
    cin >> year;
    if (year < 00 || year > 99)
    {
        cout<< "Please run the program again and enter a valid number.";
    }
    if (month * day == year)
    {
        cout<< "This date " <<month << "/"<<day << "/"<< year<< " is a magic";
    }
    else
    {
        cout<< "This date " <<month << "/"<<day << "/"<< year<< " is not magic";
    }

    return 0;
}
