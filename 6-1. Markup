Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost and its markup
percentage . It should then display the item's retail price. For examp le:
• If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup percentage is 100 percent, then
the item's retail price is $10.00 .
• If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup percentage is 50 percent, then
the item's retail price is $7.50.
The program should have a function named cal cul at eRet ai l that receives the wholesale
cost and the markup percentage as arguments and returns the retail price of the item.
