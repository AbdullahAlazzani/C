// The speed of so und varies depending on the medium through which it travels. In general, sound travels fastest in
rigid media, such as  steel, slower in liquid media, such as water, and slowest of all in gases, such as air. 
         Medium      Speed(feet per sec)
           Air            1,100
           Water          4,900
            Steel          16,400
 Write a program that displays a menu allowing the user to select air, water, or steel, then enter the number of feet a sound wave
 will travel in the selected medium. The program will then display the amount of time it will take. (Round to four decimal places.)
