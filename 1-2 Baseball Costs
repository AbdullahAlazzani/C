//Using Program 1-1 as an example, write a program that calculates
how much a Little League baseball team spent last year to purchase
new baseballs. The program should prompt the user to enter the number
of baseballs purchased and the cost of each baseball. It should then
calculate and display the total amount spent to purchase the baseballs.
