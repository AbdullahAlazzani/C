//The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows: 
distance= speed* time 
For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles. 
Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the total distance traveled at the end of each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output: 
What is the speed of the vehicle i n mph? 40 How many hours has it t raveled? 3 Hour Miles Traveled 
1 2 3 
40 80 120
